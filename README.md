# California-Fire-Visualization
An interactive visualization of California fire history. 

This project was written using Processing. Watch a demo of the visualization [here](https://youtu.be/EUFs2kdZ9pA) (To do refilm demo). 
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate working knowledge of how to build a model-view-controller. 

The datasets were too large to store on github and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n5rmoRMoYYaMU8dPRHW-SB9KnP-4-q-8?usp=sharing.).

The dataset source for fire perimeters can be found [here](https://map.dfg.ca.gov/metadata/ds0397.html).

(The reason for why there is no commit history for this repo is because this project was migrated to my portfolio account)
